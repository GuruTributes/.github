This organization is my way of saying Thank you GURU for all the knowledge you though me.

- Idea:
  - As I was working on my thessis, I've had an idea to improve old gurutributes.com, suddenly site went down. I knew that this was a perfect chance for me.
  
- Goals:
  - Don't let world forget legend such as G.U.R.U
  - To revive GuruTributes comment section
  - Keep G.U.R.U alive through comments
  - People should celebrate G.U.R.U's messages
  
- People:
```md
  
```
